> Can you be a **Proshipper** and interact with me?

> Personally I don't mind, as long as if you don't start anything, aren't in any previous drama - no weird backgrounds and no pedophilic/toxicity acts towards me. I also wouldn't enjoy hearing you talk about what you ship, but I truly do not mind hanging out with you if you respect my boundaries, and I would respect yours and yada yada.

> Making this clear - I do not support actions of **Proshippers** but I can tolerate them, interact with me if you want - but be wary, as I can easily grow tense around proshippers at times.
