▼ - > Do NOT interact with me if you're apart of the DANDYS WORLD fandom . . . I respectfully, do NOT like you guys . I have bad experience with you guys .
▼ - > Do NOT interact with me if you're one of THOSE doublefedora / forsaken fans . I like Doublefedora but if you make it cringey and 'unenjoyable' I won't HESITATE to block/hide you .


▼ - > Never interact with me if I have offtab/iwc/iwec/iwvec/dni/dniuf/dniuc/dniucf in my name . . this likely means I don't want to be bothered . If you couldn't get the hint . Even if it's just a simple whisp saying ' ____ mentioned ?! ' . Personally - it's annoying , and especially if I'm busy with chores , homework , or JROTC set practices .

▼ - > Do NOT join cuddle piles with my friends . I DO NOT KNOW YOU . WE DO NOT KNOW YOU . YOU didn't ask for PERMISSION . It makes me and my friends uncomfortable sometimes - I also may seem a bit rude , my apologies beforehand .

- Reporting . . starting July 29th, 2025 I wont be active . I have a packed highschool schedule and my mom is really strict on my internet time . There might be times we're you see me - there might not . I'll most likely be Dniucf/read gith/offtab if so . . ! My internet also might cut off for months sorry to anyone I met out there who knew me well - lol . 


. . This is me just asking to be nice to me as I'm verrrrrrrrrry sensitive this past few months - I may have mood swings verrry often . Especially with my alters . There may be times we're we aren't their completely . . our apologies . We also prefer tone tags - we have undiagnosed autism . I also space out ALOOOOOT . . I'm also with friends most times - if their not offline . . !
